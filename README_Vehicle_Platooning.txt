# Vehicle Platooning: Multi-Follower Safety Verification

## Overview

This project focuses on the formal verification of safety properties in autonomous vehicle platooning systems,
particularly addressing scenarios involving multiple follower vehicles. By leveraging formal methods, the project
ensures that vehicle platoons maintain safe distances and adhere to safety constraints under various operational
conditions.

## Key Features

- **Formal Verification**: Utilizes formal methods to rigorously prove safety properties within vehicle platooning systems.
- **Multi-Follower Analysis**: Examines scenarios where multiple autonomous vehicles follow a lead vehicle,
  ensuring coordinated and safe platoon behavior.
- **Safety Proofs**: Provides mathematical proofs to validate that the system maintains safe inter-vehicle distances
  and responds appropriately to dynamic changes.

## Project Structure

- `Platooning System_01_ Multi-Follower Safety_ Proof.kyx`: Contains the formal proof document detailing the
  safety verification process for multi-follower vehicle platooning scenarios.

## Getting Started

To explore the safety proofs:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a compatible formal verification tool or proof assistant installed (e.g., KeYmaera X).
2. **Access the Proof File**: Open the `.kyx` file using your chosen tool to review the formal safety proofs and
   understand the verification process.

## Potential Applications

- **Autonomous Vehicle Development**: Enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems
  through rigorous verification.
- **Transportation Systems**: Implementing verified platooning strategies in intelligent transportation systems
  to improve traffic flow and safety.
- **Academic Research**: Serving as a foundation for further research in formal methods applied to
  autonomous systems and vehicle coordination.
